# # Model Version Zero

This model was trained with around 100,000 images with EfficiencyNetV5 as a base

Resolution: 96 x 64 pixels

# ## Results

The model performed very poorly.
656 categories: 4% accuracy


# ## Conclusions

This model performed poorly because EfficiencyNetV5 is made for other applications.
Additionally, the images were too small.
