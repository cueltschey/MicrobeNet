#  MicrobeNet Version 1 

This model was trained several times with varying dataset sizes.
Resolution: 200 x 200 pixels

## Results

Attempt 1: 6 categories 20,000 images --> 91.33% accuracy

Attempt 2: 7 categories 25,000 images --> 95% + accuracy

note: distribution of images was poor. Half had 5,000+ and other half had < 500

-- further categories will be added in future versions --

## Conlusions

This model worked far better because it had less forzen layers and higher resolution
Trying out a YOLOv3 approach seems like a good next step
For more accuracy more images are needed ~1MIL

## Theory for Version 3

The main limitation in these few-parameter light-weight CNNs is in their number of
categories. This can be mitigated by using multiple models to achieve one goal.

In version 3 there will be a tree of models to facilitate identification.
1. The parent network will classify by family, using more broad and obvious distinctions.
2. Based upon the parents classification a child model will be selected to process the same images.
3. (possibility) an intermediate network or algorithm crops and convolves the image for a particular network
4. The child network uses particular knowledge the classify the genus of the microbe.
