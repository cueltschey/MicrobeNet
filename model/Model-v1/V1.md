# # MicrobeNet Version 1 

This model was trained several times with varying dataset sizes.
Resolution: 200 x 200 pixels

# ## Results

Attempt 1: 6 categories 20,000 images --> 91.33% accuracy

Attempt 2: 7 categories 25,000 images --> 95% + accuracy

note: distribution of images was poor. Half had 5,000+ and other half had < 500

-- further categories will be added in future versions --

# ## Conlusions

This model worked far better because it had less forzen layers and higher resolution
Trying out a YOLOv3 approach seems like a good next step
For more accuracy more images are needed ~1MIL
