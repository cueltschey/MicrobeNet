# MicrobeNet Version 3

## Some issues to address:

There are too many genera and too few images

Some stats that prove this:
~200,000 total images => 75% are large enough
~141,000 viable images for training
...
that is spread among 1,162 unique genera
that gives an average of 121 viable images for each genus
...
considering the unequal spread of images and the x3 multiplier for flipping that gives
far too few to train a good model

All of this could be fixed given more data, but with more data comes more genera

## Possible Solutions

### Option A: splitting genera into families

Pros:
* Guarantees at least some correct identification (the family)
* Maintains data organization and integrity
* Allows for an easily defined and consistent classification, reducing probability of mislabeling data
* More professional approach

Cons:
* Uneven distribution of genera among families
* Difficulty in classiifying certain rarer genera
* Some families look very similar to one another
* Too many families

### Option B: splitting genera by appearance

Pros:
* Guarantees managable and even data
* Likely easier classification for the model
* Higher possible performance

Cons:
* Easy to make mistakes and have poorly defined categories
* Data loss is possible and classification mistakes are frequent
* If classification is unsuccessful no helpful info is gathered

### Option C: Ignore genera with insufficient data

Pros:
* Solves all classification issues
* Guarantees sufficient data
* Will result in simple and effective model

Cons:
* Massive data loss (~70%)
* Less useful, since only common microbes will be identified

## Proposed Solution for Version 3

I will make a model with an attempt at Option B.
All genera will be split by general appearance and a model will be made to traverse the resulting 'tree'.
Convolution functions will be used to boost accuracy



## Results:
Around 20 categories were generated based on appearance
Two types of model will be trained using these categories
All models were trained on a google cloud virtual machine

**Child**:
This network identifies microbes within a given category, the end result being the genus of the microbe

These networks achieved good results during testing despite an uneven distribution of images
**Initial training dataset**: 12,200 images in 28 classes
**Results**: Cilliates => Accuracy 90.57% 
**Notes**: this is partially due the the higher quality of data for cilliates, but it must be noted that many cilliates are difficult to differentiate

**Parent**:
This network is designed to classify organisms based upon appearance.

**Initial training dataset**: 62,000 images non-convoluded over 17 classes
**Results**: Accuracy 88%   
**Notes**: this can easily be raised to 95+% by using a larger number of images (only around 25% of all data was used on this test)
