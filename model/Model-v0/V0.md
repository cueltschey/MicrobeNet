# MicrobeNet Version 0

## Overview + Results:
This model was trained on the full data set of 100,000 images
The Model was trained to classify ~650 classes
The result was very poor with around 4% accuracy being achieved.

Only around a 1% probability increase was seen during training

## Proposed improvements:

The poor performance can be ascribed to three main problems:

1. the model was trained on an insufficient training set:
> Convolutional Networks require very large datasets especially with a large
> number of categories.

2. the model was given a poor distribution among classes:
> The images were unevenly distributed with around 10% having 5,000+ images and the rest having <500

3. Too many of the layers were frozen:
> due to the use of efficiencynetv5 few neurons remained trainable

with the coorection of these issues a better model is attainable
