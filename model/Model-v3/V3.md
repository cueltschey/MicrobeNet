# MicrobeNet Version 3 documentation

## Convolution testing

Testing out the scharr convolution showed a 3% increase in accuracy.
This convolution kernel will be used for all future models.
The greyscaling also reduces computaitional complexity by 2/3


## Issues with Previous Versions

Version 2 suffered from three major drawbacks

1. Due to the use of arbitrary rules to seprate classes the model struggled to accurately classify. Some genera were 90+% accurate while others were 9%

2. Many of the genera in the dataset were actually species of other documented genera. Furthermore many genera only contained around 6-13 images thereby skewing the models predictions.

3. Due to the use of multiple models in conjunction the two models would have to be correct simultaneously for the results to be accurate. (90% * 88% => 79.2%) 


## Proposed Solutions

**Proposal 1**: Test both a single model and tree of models 
This is the most important change beacuse of the effect it will have on efficiency.
It is worth testing the efficacy of a single model to assess the data, thereby sidestepping the issue of classifying the images further.
For this model all genera with less than 200 images will be ignored thereby increasing accuracy

A tree type multi-model will also be tested.
This tree will be structured generally according to families of organisms, with any outliers being ignored.
This will allow for genera with less images to be kept.


**Proposal 2**: Use scharr Convolution
All models will use a scharr convolution to help speed along training.
The matrix is as follows:
 -3 + 0i   0 + 0i   +3 + 0i
 -10 + 0i   0 + 0i  +10 + 0i
  -3 + 0i   0 + 0i   +3 + 0i

**Proposal 3**: More data
Experimentations with smaller images will allow for more of the data to be used by the model.
The issue here is balancing image size and quantity for optimum perdormance.
